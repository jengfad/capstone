Capstone Direction
- Change application from Ospital ng Makati to Generic Application of Vaccine Certificates.
- Should be a Proof-of-Concept implementation



Statement of the Problem
- Too broad should be more specific to file storage and blockchain security for Covid-19 Vaccination Certificates.



Objectives
- Remove Objective #1 (about decentralized storage)
- Focus on PoA Blockchain Consensus, Merkle DAG aspect of IPFS and File Encryption/Decryption Algorithm
- Add security validation as objective





- additional (from panel consultation)
- Specific on Testing Aspects (max of 2 criteria)
- SHA 512
- verify blockchain cryptography
- rrl - 256 vs 512
- more focused on block of blockchain
