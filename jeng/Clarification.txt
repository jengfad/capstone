PANEL FEEDBACK

Capstone Direction
- Change application from Ospital ng Makati to Generic Application of Vaccine Certificates.
- Should be a Proof-of-Concept implementation

Statement of the Problem
- Too broad should be more specific to file storage and blockchain security for Covid-19 Vaccination Certificates.

Objectives
- Remove Objective #1 (about decentralized storage)
- Focus on PoA Blockchain Consensus, Merkle DAG aspect of IPFS and File Encryption/Decryption Algorithm
- Add security validation as objective
