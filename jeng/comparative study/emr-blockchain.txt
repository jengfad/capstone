*MedRec: Using Blockchain for Medical Data Access and Permission Management 
- Azaria, Asaph; Ekblaw, Ariel; Vieira, Thiago; Lippman, Andrew; 2016
- shown how principles of decentralization might be applied to largescale data management in an EMR system.
- We demonstrate an innovative approach for handling medical records, providing auditability, interoperability and accessibility via a comprehensive log.
- Ethereum + data is stored in centralized SQL


*Secure Cloud Storage Architecture for Digital Medical Record in Cloud Environment using Blockchain 
- Sharma, Saurabh; Mishra, Ashish; Lala, Ajay; Singhai, Deeksha; 2020
- pow blockchain, cloud database, did not specify encryption algo 


-----------------------------------------------------------------
blockchain + ipfs


*A Secure and Distributed Framework for sharing COVID-19 patient Reports using Consortium Blockchain and IPFS
- Kumar, Randhir and Tripathi, Rakesh 2020
- pow, ipfs
-  To receive the Proof of Identity (PoI), the healthcare provider must participate (register) in a consortium network.
- patient does not have access to system
- system is more of a provider to provider data sharing
- not encrypted

*Electronic medical record security sharing model based on blockchain
- Wu, Sihua; Du, Jiang  2019
- DPOS delegated proof of stake
- medical images in DCM format
- data masking instead of encryption
- no access control for patient
- does not encrypt uploaded files in IPFS


-----------------------------------------------------------------

blockchain + ipfs + encryption

*Blockchain-based secure storage and access scheme for electronic medical records in IPFS
- Sun, Jin; Yao, Xiaomin; Wang, Shangping; Wu, Ying; 2020
- attribute-based encryption system, blockchain technology, and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) storage platform.
- The scheme provides good access control for the electronic medical records using attribute-based encryption technology so that people who are not related to the patient cannot see the private data of the patient without authorized


*A Framework for Blockchain-based Smart Health System
- Khubrani, Mousa Mohammed 2021
- in this paper, the researcher proposed a theoretical blockchain-based framework via blockchain, ipfs and asymmetric encryption. DID NOT mention what type of blockchain or setup of ipfs.











--------------------------------

POA as alternative


*Decentralized secure storage of medical records using Blockchain and IPFS: A comparative analysis with future directions
- Kumar, Shivansh;  Bharti, Aman Kumar; Amin, Ruhul; 2021
- comparative study only of conceptual frameworks based on ipfs and blockchain
- working with Consortium Blockchain requires more energy consumption, and to make it scalable it will take more resources and very few researchers have provided a mechanism that how the consortium Blockchain is made, how different entities are registering themselves in the Blockchain. It is one of the main issues that one can work to solve


*Permission-Based Blockchain with Proof of Authority for Secured Healthcare Data Sharing
- Al Asad, Nafiz; Elahi, Md. Tausif; Al Hasan, Abdullah; Yousuf, Mohammad Abu  Abdullah Al Hasan et al 2020
- explains why POA is an excellent solution for medical records storage

*Decentralized Patient Centric e-Health Record Management System using Blockchain and IPFS
- Reen, Gaganjeet  2019
- conceptual model only. no implementation
- mentioned PoA as best choice for medical records but did not give out technical specifics
- public ipfs, asymmetric encryption


--------------------------------

NOT USED




Enhanced Decentralized Management of Patient-Driven Interoperability Based on Blockchain
- Khan, Asad Ullah; Shahid, Affaf; Tariq, Fatima; Ghaffar, Abdul; Jamal, Abid; Abbas, Shahid; Javaid, Nadeem; (2019)
- proposed POA and ipfs
- no encryption of uploaded files
- proposed poa but still relies on block mining w/c is why gas fees is reliant to file size


Towards a Blockchain-based Secure Electronic Medical Record for Healthcare Applications
- poa but no ipfs



Distributed Off-Chain Storage of Patient Diagnostic Reports in Healthcare System Using IPFS and Blockchain
- paper not available in scihub



An Electronic Medical Record Management System based on Smart Contracts
- Chen, Yeong-Sheng; Yang, Wei-Kai; Chen, Jie-Si  2019
- public ipfs
- ethereum pow
- medical personnel are in control of patient data
- attribute based encryption



An Attribute-Based Distributed Data Sharing Scheme
- Ehab Zaghloul, Tongtong Li and Jian Ren 2018
- focused on IPFS and attribused based encryption
- CAN BE A REFERENCE FOR IPFS related stuff
- fine grained control on records
- not user friendly because patient will run IPFS on command line LOL



Secure Medical Record Sharing using Blockchain and Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- Emrul Kais et al 2019
- CHAPTER 2 CAN BE COPIED FOR REFERENCE LOL
- Ethereum PoW + AE + IPFS (Public)
- Access Control List - Smart Contract
- was focused more on implementing Elliptic Curve Cryptography in encrypting/decrypting files
